# Eye Disease Classification Model

## Introduction

This project entails the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of eye diseases using image data. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model aims to accurately identify common eye conditions such as cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and normal eye states. The classification results are intended to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing eye diseases efficiently.
